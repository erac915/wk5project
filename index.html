                        <p>Just beat the devil out of it. At home you have unlimited time. That is when you can experience true joy, when you have no fear. In your world you can create anything you desire. This is the way you take out your flustrations. In painting, you have unlimited power. You have the ability to move mountains.</p>

                        <p>Very easy to work these to death. It's cold, but it's beautiful. You have to make almighty decisions when you're the creator. In your imagination you can go anywhere you want. I'm gonna add just a tiny little amount of Prussian Blue. Brown is such a nice color.</p>
                        
                        <p>This is your world, whatever makes you happy you can put in it. Go crazy. Now we can begin working on lots of happy little things. Don't kill all your dark areas - you need them to show the light. Imagination is the key to painting. From all of us here, I want to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friends.</p>
                        
                        <p>I'm gonna start with a little Alizarin crimson and a touch of Prussian blue We don't make mistakes we just have happy little accidents. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. It's all a game of angles. We'll play with clouds today.</p>
                        
                        <p>There's not a thing in the world wrong with washing your brush. These little son of a guns hide in your brush and you just have to push them out. A fan brush can be your best friend. If what you're doing doesn't make you happy - you're doing the wrong thing. We'll put a happy little bush here. Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not wasted.</p>
                        
                        <p>Every single thing in the world has its own personality - and it is up to you to make friends with the little rascals. Let's put some highlights on these little trees. The sun wouldn't forget them. If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path. We need a shadow side and a highlight side. No pressure. Just relax and watch it happen. Just let this happen. We just let this flow right out of our minds.</p>
                        
                        <p>The only prerequisite is that it makes you happy. If it makes you happy then it's good. No worries. No cares. Just float and wait for the wind to blow you around. Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes. Those great big fluffy clouds. It's so important to do something every day that will make you happy. You can create beautiful things - but you have to see them in your mind first.</p>
